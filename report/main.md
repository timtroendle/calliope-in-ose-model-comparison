## Baseline scenario

Figure @fig:timeseries-baseline shows the generation and demand time series:

![Generation profiles.](../build/output/baseline/plot.png){ #fig:timeseries-baseline .class}

The capacities that have been installed per country are shown in Table @tbl:installed-capacities-baseline.

```table

And here, i.e. in Table @tbl:trade-baseline, the electricity traded between countries.

```table

```

## Low cost scenario

In the low cost scneario, the capacities that have been installed per country are shown in Table @tbl:installed-capacities-low-cost.

```table
