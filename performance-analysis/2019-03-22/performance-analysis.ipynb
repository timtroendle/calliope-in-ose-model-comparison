    "Interestingly, the runs with the same parameter set always lead to the same objective value and the same number of iterations. The found objective value can be called close enough for all chosen tolerance values. The largest tolerance needed only a third of the number of iterations and only 40% of the time of the default value set (e-6).\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT, Barrier seems to be sensitive to the tolerances: the medium value of e-4 performed worse in terms of time than the more tight parameter set of e-6, despite needing about 25% less iterations. Potentially, this may stem from the fact that the model has numerical issues, see ranges below. It would be good to solve the numerical issues through scaling and then repeat this experiment.\n",
